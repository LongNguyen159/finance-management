        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Input Fields Explained</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">Hereâ€™s a quick guide to help you fill in the input fields:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                <strong>Type:</strong> Choose what you're entering:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-1" style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Income:</strong> Money you earn (no need to fill out the "Source from" field).</li>
                    <li><strong>Expense:</strong> Money you spend. Use "Source from" to specify where the expense comes from (e.g., rent or groceries). This is optional. If not specified, it is automatically understood that expense has source from income.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax:</strong> The tax amount. You can only enter this once!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                <strong>Name:</strong> Give your entry a name (like "Rent" or "Groceries"). This helps you remember what the money is for.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                <strong>Value:</strong> Enter the amount of money (like "800" for rent).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Source from (optional):</strong> This is mostly for you to specify what made up an expense. For example, if you enter "Housing," you might want to specify it includes "Rent" and "Utilities.", which has source from "Housing".
            </li>
        </ul>
             
    </section>

    <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What Happens Next?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">As you add entries:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li>If you enter more than one income, the app will calculate your total income.</li>
            <li>If you enter a tax amount, the app will show your "usable income" after tax is deducted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Note:</strong> You should not enter many entries with the same name, although it might work, but the total expense calculation will not be accurate anymore.</p>
